# The Cepheus Engine Toolbox for Referees

The Cepheus Engine Toolbox for Referees is an application to allow Cepheus Engine RPG players to quickly roll dice and randomly generate characters, worlds, sectors etc.

It is based on the [Cepheus Engine SRD][cepheus] rules, which are available from [DriveThruRPG][cepheus].

## Running the scripts

To run the `.py` scripts, you'll need Python installed on your machine. If you are running MacOS or Linux, you probably already have Python installed. If you are running MacOS or Linux, you probably already have Python installed. If you're on Windows, it's available from the [Python website][py] or from the Microsoft Store.

Most of the Python `.py` scripts can be executed from the command-line (Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows), as long as you have Python installed. Some of the scripts take a number as a command-line argument. For example, to generate one world, run:

`> python world.py`

But to generate 20 worlds, run:

`> python world.py 20`

Some scripts won't output anything when you run them. Don't panic! This just means that script wasn't written to be executed directly but instead contains stuff used somewhere else in the toolbox.
